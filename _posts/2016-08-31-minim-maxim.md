Time to swap pen for pixel and page for platform. I fired up Illustrator and set about transferring my roughs from paper to screen. This is where the 'fun' really starts and you begin to fully appreciate the self-imposed task at hand. But there is such huge satisfaction to be earned from moulding the mathematical and embracing the apparently constraining in the attempt to produce something pleasing to they eye. I like to think that the end justified the effort.
